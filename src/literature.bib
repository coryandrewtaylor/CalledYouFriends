This is due to the unprecedented growth of social-related data, boosted by the proliferation of social media websites and the embedded heterogeneity and complexity. Alongside the machine learning derives much effort from psychologists to build computational model for solving tasks like recognition, prediction, planning and analysis even in uncertain situations. Therefore, it is significant to study the synergy of machine learning techniques in social network analysis, focus on practical applications, and open avenues for further research. In this paper, we have reviewed the theoretical aspects of social network analysis with a combination of machine learning-based techniques, its representation, tools and techniques used for analysis. Additionally, the source of data and its applications are also highlighted in this paper.},

We derive the networks from di- alogue interactions, and thus our method depends on the ability to determine when two characters are in conversation. Our approach involves character name chunk- ing, quoted speech attribution and conver- sation detection given the set of quotes. We extract features from the social net- works and examine their correlation with one another, as well as with metadata such as the novel's setting. Our results provide evidence that the majority of novels in this time period do not fit two characterizations provided by literacy scholars. Instead, our results suggest an alternative explanation for differences in social networks.},

Among these are detailed studies presenting fresh perspectives on characters who play a major role in the Gospel (e.g., Peter, Mary Magdalene, etc.), as well as original studies of characters who have never been the focus of narrative analysis before, characters often glossed over in commentaries as insignificant (e.g., the boy with the loaves and fish, the parents of the man born blind, etc.). Clearly, characters in John stand in the shadow of the protagonist -- Jesus. In this volume, however, they step fully into the light. Thus illuminated, it becomes clear how complex and nuanced many of them are.},

This ambiguity has an important literary function: it invites the reader to understand biblical characters within the context of the inherent logic of the Gospel. The Gospel establishes ideals like believing and abiding in Jesus. The reader is left to decide to what extent a character's actions and speech reflect these aims. Individual character portraits explore what readers may learn from studying John's complex characters. This is an excellent secondary source for seminary classes on the fourth Gospel.},

@book{Moretti2013DistantReading,
abstract = {WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD How does a literary historian end up thinking in terms of z-scores, principal component analysis, and clustering coefficients? The essays in Distant Reading led to a new and often contested paradigm of literary analysis. In presenting them here Franco Moretti reconstructs his intellectual trajectory, the theoretical influences over his work, and explores the polemics that have often developed around his positions.From the evolutionary model of “Modern European Literature,” through the geo-cultural insights of “Conjectures of World Literature” and “Planet Hollywood,” to the quantitative findings of “Style, inc.” and the abstract patterns of “Network Theory, Plot Analysis,” the book follows two decades of conceptual development, organizing them around the metaphor of “distant reading,” that has come to define—well beyond the wildest expectations of its author—a growing field of unorthodox literary studies.From the Trade Paperback edition.},

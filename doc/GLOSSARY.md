## Betweenness centrality
Measures the extent to which a node acts as a bridge between two otherwise distinct groups of nodes, and thus how important it is for the flow of information between communities [@BoccalettiEtAl2006Complex].

## Closeness centrality
Quantifies how important a node is within a community. A node at the center of a community will have a higher closeness centrality than a node on the fringes of the group.

## Community
A group of nodes that are more tightly connected to each other than they are to nodes outside the group.

## Degree
The number of connections a node has. For directed networks, degree may be further divided into outdegree and indegree.

## Eigenvector centrality
A measure of a nodeâ€™s overall importance within its network. A node will have a high eigenvector centrality if it is connected to other important nodes.

## Indegree
In a directed network, the number of inbound connections a node has.

## Outdegree
In a directed network, the number of outbound connections a node has.

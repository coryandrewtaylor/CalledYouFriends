# Mark Notes

- εἰσπορεύονται with implicit subject in Mk 1:21: "The newly gathered ‘Jesus circle’ already operates as a defined group, so that the plural verb εἰσπορεύονται needs no expressed subject." [@France_2002, p. 101]
- In Mark, pericopae will often end with a brief epilogue involving a change of scene, e.g. 1:35-38 and 1:39, 1:40-44 and 1:45, 5:1-19 and 5:20, 6:1-6a and 6b, 7:24-29 and 7:30.
- I assume that 8:27b-33 occur on the way to Caesarea Philippi, with 8:34ff. occuring once X and disciples have arrived.
- Several epilogues happen "in the house" (e.g. 10:10). Is this house one in the region where X is teaching, where he happens to be a guest, or is it his house back in his hometown?
